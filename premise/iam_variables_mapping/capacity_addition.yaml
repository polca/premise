#This file contains the mapping of capacity addition variables.
#
#INFRASTRUCTURE SOURCE APPROACH:
#The system uses infrastructure datasets directly as capacity addition inputs:
#- Finds infrastructure datasets matching the filter criteria
#- Removes (zeros out) these datasets from all operational activities in the database
#- Creates unified capacity addition datasets scaled to 1GW capacity
#- Supports multiple filter blocks for combining different technologies
#
#Configuration structure:
#- fltr: Filter specification (can be single object or list of objects)
#  - For single filter: all matching datasets are combined
#  - For multiple filters: one representative dataset per filter block
#  - Within each filter, lists use AND logic (all terms must match)
#  - Supported filter fields:
#    - name: substring matching (string or list)
#    - reference product: substring matching (string or list)
#    - unit: exact matching (string)
#    - mask: exclusion filtering (string or list)
#- iam_aliases: Mapping to IAM model variables (e.g., remind: "New Cap|Electricity|+|Solar")
#
#Process flow:
#1. Find all datasets matching filter criteria
#2. Remove matched datasets from all operational activities (cancellation)
#3. Select representative dataset(s):
#   - Single filter: first matched dataset
#   - Multiple filters: first dataset from each filter block
#4. Scale representative(s) to contribute to 1GW capacity
#5. Create unified capacity addition dataset with all representatives as inputs
#6. Generate regional variants
#
#Example configurations:
#- Single technology: one filter block finds all relevant infrastructure
#- Multi-component technology: multiple filter blocks (e.g., wind fixed + moving parts)
#- Complex filtering: use name lists for AND logic, mask for exclusions
