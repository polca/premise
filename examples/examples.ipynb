    "This notebook shows examples on how to use `premise` to adapt the life cycle inventory database [ecoinvent](https://www.ecoinvent.org/) for prospective environmental impact assessment.\n",

    "This library extracts useful information from IAM output files (e.g., REMIND, IMAGE, GCAM, TIAM-UCL) and aligns inventories in the ecoinvent database accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "As of premise 2.3.x, the following sector updates are available:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `update(\"biomass\")`: creates regional biomass markets and splits purpose-grown vs. residual biomass\n",
    "* `update(\"battery\")`: scales battery pack mass and creates mobile/stationary battery markets\n",
    "* `update(\"electricity\")`: creates regional electricity markets and updates generation efficiencies\n",
    "* `update(\"cement\")`: regionalizes clinker/cement production and adjusts kiln efficiency/CCS\n",
    "* `update(\"steel\")`: regionalizes steel production routes and adjusts process efficiencies\n",
    "* `update(\"cdr\")`: adds carbon dioxide removal routes (e.g., DACCS, BECCS) where mapped\n",
    "* `update(\"fuels\")`: creates regional markets for liquid and gaseous fuels\n",
    "* `update(\"heat\")`: regionalizes heat/steam production and relinks to fuel markets\n",
    "* `update(\"emissions\")`: scales pollutant emissions using GAINS projections\n",
    "* `update(\"metals\")`: updates metal supply chains and material intensity factors\n",
    "* `update(\"mining\")`: updates mining waste treatment and regional mining markets\n",
    "* `update(\"renewable\")`: updates wind turbine inventories and deployment where mapped\n",

    "* `update(\"cars\")`, `update(\"two_wheelers\")`, `update(\"trucks\")`, `update(\"buses\")`, `update(\"trains\")`, `update(\"ships\")`: update transport inventories and fleet averages\n",
