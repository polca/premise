*premise* allows to align the life cycle inventories contained in the ecoinvent_ 3 cutoff database.
with the output results of Integrated Assessment Models (IAM), such as REMIND_ or IMAGE_,
in order to produce life cycle inventories under future policy scenarios for any year between 2005 and 2100.

As shown in the workflow diagram above, *premise* will:

* extract the ecoinvent database.
* add to this database a number of additional inventories relating to future pathways for producing certain commodities (electricity, steel, cement, etc.)
* modify the ecoinvent database in terms of process efficiency and markets, mostly.
* load the database back into a brightway project, or as a set of CSV files.



Provided a decryption key (ask the maintainers_), the following IAM scenarios are available when installing *premise*:

 =================== =========================================================================================== ================== =============
  SSP/RCP scenario    Description                                                                                 REMIND             IMAGE

  SSP2-RCP2.6         Limit the global temperature increase to <2C by 2100, compared to pre-industrial levels.    SSP2-PkBudg1300    SSP2-RCP26
  SSP2-RCP1.9         Limit the global temperature increase to 1.5C by 2100, compared to pre-industrial levels.   SSP2-PkBudg900     SSP2-RCP19
 =================== =========================================================================================== ================== =============

CarbonBrief_ wrote a very good article explaining the meaning of the SSP/RCP system.

You can however use any other scenario files generated by REMIND or IMAGE. If you wish to use an IAM file
which has not been generated by either of these two models, you should contact the maintainers_.

Requirements
------------
* Python language interpreter **3.9**
* License for ecoinvent 3
* brightway2 (optional)

How to install this package?
----------------------------

Two options:

A development version with the latest advancements (but with the risks of unseen bugs),
is available on Conda:

.. code-block:: python

    conda install -c romainsacchi premise

For a more stable and proven version, from Pypi:

.. code-block:: python

    pip install premise

will install the package and the required dependencies.
