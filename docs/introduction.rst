In a nutshell
"""""""""""""

Purpose
-------

*premise* enables the alignment of life cycle inventories within the ecoinvent_
3.8-3.11 database, using either a "cut-off" or "consequential"
system model, to match the output results of Integrated
Assessment Models (IAMs) such as REMIND_ (and REMIND-EU), IMAGE_ or TIAM-UCL_.
This allows for the creation of life cycle inventory databases
under future policy scenarios for any year between 2005 and 2100.

   * - Model
     - Description
   * - REMIND
     - REMIND (Regionalized Model of Investment and Development) is an integrated assessment model that combines macroeconomic growth, energy system, and climate policy analysis. It is designed to analyze long-term energy transition pathways, accounting for technological, economic, and environmental factors. REMIND simulates how regions invest in different technologies and energy resources to balance economic growth and climate targets, while considering factors like energy efficiency, emissions, and resource availability. The model is particularly strong in its detailed representation of energy markets and macroeconomic interactions across regions, making it valuable for global climate policy assessments.
   * - REMIND-EU
     - REMIND-EU is a regionalized version of the REMIND model, specifically tailored to analyze energy systems and climate policies within the European Union. It incorporates detailed representations of EU member states' energy markets, technological options, and policy frameworks. It allows for a more granular analysis of how EU-specific policies, such as the European Green Deal, affect energy transition pathways, emissions reductions, and economic development within the EU context.
   * - IMAGE
     - IMAGE (Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment) is a comprehensive IAM developed to explore the interactions between human development, energy consumption, and environmental systems over the long term. It focuses on assessing how land use, food systems, energy systems, and climate change interact under different policy scenarios. The model integrates biophysical processes, such as land-use change and greenhouse gas emissions, with socio-economic drivers like population growth and economic development. IMAGE is commonly used for analyzing sustainable development strategies, climate impacts, biodiversity loss, and exploring mitigation and adaptation options.
   * - TIAM-UCL
     - TIAM-UCL (TIMES Integrated Assessment Model by University College London) is a global energy system model based on the TIMES (The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System) framework, developed to evaluate long-term decarbonization pathways for global energy systems. It provides detailed insights into energy technology options, resource availability, and emission reduction strategies under various climate policy scenarios. The model focuses on the trade-offs and synergies between energy security, economic costs, and environmental outcomes. TIAM-UCL is frequently used to analyze scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement and examine technological innovation's role in mitigating climate change globally.

**REMIND**

REMIND (Regionalized Model of Investment and Development) is a CGE-based energy-economy IAM with perfect
foresight. Its main strength lies in capturing interactions between macroeconomic growth and energy
transitions across 12–13 global regions. Compared to IMAGE, REMIND provides more detailed energy market
and investment dynamics, but it lacks IMAGE's rich land-use and biodiversity modules. Compared to
TIAM-UCL, REMIND emphasizes macroeconomic feedbacks over technological granularity, making it
better for studying long-term global climate policies rather than detailed technology pathways.
REMIND-EU builds directly on REMIND but adds EU-specific regionalization.

**REMIND-EU**

REMIND-EU is a regionalized version of REMIND, designed to analyze the European Union’s energy
transition with country-level resolution (at least, for France, Germany, and the UK). It retains
REMIND’s CGE approach and perfect foresight but includes EU-specific policies and technologies,
which are less detailed in the global REMIND model. Compared to IMAGE, REMIND-EU still lacks a
strong land-use component, but its granularity for  EU energy systems makes it preferable for
studying European Green Deal scenarios. Compared to TIAM-UCL, REMIND-EU has less technology detail
but better macroeconomic and cross-sectoral insights for EU policymaking.

**IMAGE**

IMAGE (Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment) is a simulation-based IAM with a
recursive-dynamic structure (myopic foresight). It excels in land-use, agriculture, and
biodiversity modeling, making it the best choice for scenarios that involve climate–ecosystem
interactions. Compared to REMIND and TIAM-UCL, IMAGE has less detailed energy system modeling and
no explicit macroeconomic CGE framework. However, its biophysical integration and land-use modeling
(unlike TIAM-UCL, which lacks this entirely) makes it complementary to energy-focused models.

**TIAM-UCL**

TIAM-UCL is a bottom-up, technology-rich energy system model based on linear optimization
with perfect foresight. It focuses on detailed technology pathways, energy supply chains,
and long-term decarbonization strategies. Compared to REMIND and IMAGE, TIAM-UCL lacks
macroeconomic modeling and has no integrated land-use module, but it provides superior
technology detail and resource-specific analyses (e.g., hydrogen pathways, renewables
deployment). It is particularly suited for Paris Agreement-compliant energy transitions
and cost-optimal technology portfolios.

Choosing the Right IAM
----------------------

Selecting the appropriate IAM for use with *premise* depends on the focus of your study:

- **REMIND** is best suited for **global energy–economy transition analyses** where the interplay between macroeconomic growth, energy markets, and climate policies is key.
- **REMIND-EU** is ideal for **EU-focused studies**, particularly those assessing the **European Green Deal** or country-level decarbonization strategies within the EU.
- **IMAGE** is the preferred choice when **land-use change, agriculture, biodiversity, or climate–ecosystem interactions** are central to the analysis. Its biophysical and environmental modules complement energy-focused IAMs.
- **TIAM-UCL** is most appropriate for exploring **detailed technology pathways**, resource allocation, and **cost-optimal energy system designs**, particularly for **Paris Agreement-compatible scenarios**.

Our recommendation is to assess the sensitivity of your results across different IAMs for a given climate target.
IAMs will deploy different technologies and resources to achieve the same climate target, which will lead to different life cycle inventories.

Additionally, the level of sectoral integration in *premise* varies across IAMs, which can affect the results.

   :align: center

The table and plot show how *premise* connects to IMAGE, REMIND, REMIND-EU, and TIAM-UCL,
focusing on energy generation, industry, and transport:

* REMIND and REMIND-EU have the broadest coverage, with strong mappings in electricity (34 variables), fuels (42 variables), and transport, especially passenger cars (60 variables) and road freight (40 variables).
* IMAGE offers extensive integration (417 variables), particularly in electricity (51 variables), fuels (53 variables), and industrial sectors like cement (10 variables) and steel (22 variables). However, two-wheelers are not covered by IMAGE.
* TIAM-UCL is highly detailed in electricity (61 variables), fuels (55 variables), and road freight (50 variables) but has lower coverage in cement and heat compared to REMIND and IMAGE.

Sectoral observations:

* Electricity and fuels remain the most consistently mapped sectors across all models.
* Transport sub-sectors (bus, passenger cars, rail, road, and sea freight) are well represented in REMIND(-EU) and TIAM-UCL, with IMAGE covering all except two-wheelers.
* Industrial sectors, particularly steel and cement, are better represented in IMAGE and REMIND(-EU) than in TIAM-UCL.

Choosing the right scenario
---------------------------

The criteria for scenario selection depend on the objective of the study.
One possible criterion is the climate target, which can be expressed as the
global mean surface temperature (GMST) increase by 2100.

Here is a comparison across scenarios with respect to the global mean surface
temperature (GMST) increase by 2100:

Hence, the choice of model and scenario is usually a weighted trade-off between:

1. the characteristics of the model (e.g., regionalization, technology detail, land-use modeling, myopic vs. perfect foresight, etc.),
2. the climate target (e.g., 1.5°C, 2.0°C, etc.),
3. the extent of sectoral integration (e.g., how many sectors are mapped in *premise*), and
4. the availability of scenarios (e.g., some models have more scenarios than others).

CarbonBrief_ wrote a good article explaining the meaning of the SSP system.

Note that while scenarios are denominated by their SSP family, they do not follow a uniform
system to describe the climate objective. For example, *REMIND* uses *NDC*, *NPi* and *carbon peak budgets*
(650 and 1000 GtC) climate trajectories, while *IMAGE* uses *medium*, *low*, and *very low* forcing scenarios
(with or without overshoot), and TIAM-UCL uses *Representative Concentration Pathways* (RCPs)
to denote the climate target (e.g., RCP 1.9, 2.6, 4.5 and Base).


Additionally, we provided a summary of the main characteristics of each scenario `here <https://premisedash-6f5a0259c487.herokuapp.com/>`_.

If you wish to use an IAM file which has not been generated by either of these
above-listed models, you should refer to the **Mapping** section.

Workflow
--------

.. image:: main_workflow.png

As illustrated in the workflow diagram above, *premise* follows an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL_) process:

1. Extract the ecoinvent database from a Brightway_ project or from ecospold2_ files.
2. Expand the database by adding additional inventories for future production pathways for certain commodities, such as electricity, heat, steel, cement, etc.
3. Modify the ecoinvent database, focusing primarily on process efficiency improvements and market adjustments.
4. Load the updated database back into a Brightway project or export it as a set of CSV files, such as Simapro CSV files.

Requirements
------------
* Python language interpreter **>=3.9**
* License for ecoinvent 3
* Brightway 2 or 2.5 (optional)

.. note::

    If you wish to export Brightway 2.5-compatible databases, you will need to upgrade `bw2data` to >= 4.0.0.

How to install this package?
----------------------------

Two options:

From Pypi:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install premise

will install the package and the required dependencies.

``premise`` comes with the latest version of ``brightway``, which is Brightway 2.5.
This means that ``premise`` will output databases that are compatible with Brightway 2.5.

If you want to use the results in the Brightway 2 framework (e.g., to read them in ``activity-browser``),
you need to specify it in the installation command:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install "premise[bw2]"

You can also specify that you want to use Brightway 2.5:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install "premise[bw25]"

A development version with the latest advancements (but with the risks of unseen bugs),
is available from Anaconda Cloud. Similarly, you should specify that you want to use Brightway 2.5:

.. code-block:: console

    conda install -c conda-forge premise-bw25

Or rather use Brightway2 (for Activity Browser-compatibility):

.. code-block:: console

    conda install -c conda-forge premise-bw2

How to use it?

Examples notebook
*****************

`This notebook <https://github.com/polca/premise/blob/master/examples/examples.ipynb>`_ will show
you everything you need to know to use *premise*.

ScenarioLink plugin
*******************
There now exists a plugin for Activity Browser, called ScenarioLink, which allows you to
directly download IAM scenario-based premise databases from the browser, without the use of premise.
You can find it `here <https://github.com/polca/ScenarioLink>`_.
